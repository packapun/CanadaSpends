				<Intro>
					Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) are two distinct federal departments tasked with advancing Indigenous priorities in Canada. Established in 2017 following the dissolution of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), these departments manage different aspects of Indigenous policy, service delivery, and governance.

				</Intro>
				<Intro>
					ISC is responsible for providing essential services to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, including healthcare, education, housing, and child and family services. It also works to transfer control of these services to Indigenous-led organizations. CIRNAC focuses on treaty negotiations, self-government agreements, land claims, and Northern affairs, aiming to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships and modernize Indigenous governance structures. Together, ISC and CIRNAC oversee key programs that impact Indigenous communities across Canada.

					Federal spending on Indigenous priorities may fluctuate over time due to population growth, policy shifts, and emerging challenges such as climate change and infrastructure deficits. Since 1995, total federal spending has risen by 74.9%, while spending on Indigenous priorities has increased by 592%, reflecting expanded program commitments and new governance agreements and claim settlements.
				</P>
				<P>
					Despite these increases, significant challenges remain in areas such as housing, healthcare access, and infrastructure in remote Indigenous communities.
