				<Intro>
					Global Affairs Canada (GAC) is the federal department responsible for managing Canada's diplomatic relations, international trade, and development assistance. Established in 1909 as the Department of External Affairs, GAC has evolved to oversee Canada's engagement in global affairs, promoting national interests abroad and ensuring the protection of Canadian citizens overseas. The department negotiates international agreements, administers trade policies, and provides humanitarian aid. Additionally, it supports Canadian businesses in expanding internationally and strengthens diplomatic ties through multilateral organizations like the United Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and NATO. GAC also plays a critical role in crisis response, assisting Canadians abroad during emergencies, and fostering global security and stability.
