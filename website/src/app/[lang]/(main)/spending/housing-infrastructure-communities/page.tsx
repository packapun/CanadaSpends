					Federal spending may shift over time due to population growth, changes in policy and programs, and emerging problems to address.
				</P>
				<P>
					When HICC was founded in FY 2005 as the Office of Infrastructure Canada, the department’s spending has grown from $250,000 to over $14 billion, a significant increase in overall spending and mandate. In FY 2024, HICC accounted for 2.8% of all federal spending.
				</P>
				<P>
					Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly influence government spending year to year. For instance, during the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from $410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to $720.3 billion in 2021.
				</P>
				<P>
					Similarly, HICC expenditures experienced notable fluctuations during this period, surging from approximately $5.9 billion​ in 2019 (adjusted for inflation) to $14.5B in 2024.
